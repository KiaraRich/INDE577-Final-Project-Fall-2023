### Student: Kiara A. Richardson

### Contact: kar15@rice.edu

### Instructor: Randy R. Davila

### Course and Project Description

This course covers the fundamentals of data science and machine learning. Topics include: introduction to scikit-learn, Keras and tensorflow2, linear and logistic regression, clustering, support vector machines, random forest trees, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing. This repository contains 4 folders for my Final Project: Computational and Applied Mathematics Examples, Data Science Foundations, Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised Learning. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that showcase the skills I learned throughout this semester-long course.
