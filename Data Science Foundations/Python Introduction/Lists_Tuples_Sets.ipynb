    "# Lists, Tuples, and Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists, tuples, and sets are three different types of data structures that are used to store collections of items. Each has its own characteristics and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items. Mutable means that you can change the contents of a list by adding or removing elements. Lists are created using square brackets [  ].\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutable: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify, add, or remove elements after the list is created. This makes them suitable for situations where you need to frequently update or alter the contents of the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements based on their indices. You can access elements by their position in the list, starting from index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Cases: Lists are suitable when you need to store and manipulate an ordered collection of items. For example, a list could represent a sequence of tasks, a collection of numbers, or any other ordered set of elements."

    "\n",
    "* Immutable: Tuples, once created, cannot be modified. You cannot add, remove, or change elements in a tuple. This immutability provides a level of data integrity.\n",

    "* Ordered: Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements. You can access elements by their position in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Cases: Tuples are useful when you want to create a collection of items that should not be changed during the program's execution. For example, coordinates (x, y) in a 2D space or representing fixed configurations."
