    "# Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing\n",

    "**Statistical Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It involves using statistical methods to analyze and interpret data, allowing researchers to make generalizations or infer properties of the entire population from which the sample is drawn. There are two main branches of statistical inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimation\n",
    "    - Estimation involves estimating unknown parameters of a population based on sample data. This can include point estimation, where a single value is used to estimate a parameter, or interval estimation, where a range of values is provided as an estimate along with a level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "    - Hypothesis testing is a method for making inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It involves testing a specific hypothesis about the population parameter to determine whether there is enough evidence in the sample data to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a formal statistical method for making decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate Hypotheses:\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$: This is a statement of no effect or no difference, often representing the status quo or a default assumption.\n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis $(H_1)$ or $(H_a)$: This is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and represents the effect or difference that the researcher is trying to detect.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Choose Significance Level $(\\alpha)$:\n",
    "    - The significance level, often denoted by $\\alpha$, represents the probability of making a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis). Commonly used values for $\\alpha$ include 0.05 and 0.01.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Collect and Analyze Data:\n",
    "    - Collect a sample of data and perform statistical analysis, depending on the nature of the hypothesis being tested (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Calculate Test Statistic and P-value:\n",
    "    - Compute a test statistic that summarizes the information from the sample and calculate the p-value, which represents the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Make a Decision:\n",
    "    - Compare the p-value to the significance level:\n",
    "        - If $p≤α$, reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n",
    "        - If $p>α$, fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the alternative hypothesis is true."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we conducted a hypothesis test to investigate whether the average height of a randomly selected sample of individuals is significantly different from a known population mean of 170 cm. The two-sided t-test yielded a t-statistic of ```t_statistic``` and a p-value of ```p_value```. With a pre-defined significance level $(\\alpha)$ of 0.05, we compared the p-value to alpha and found that ```p_value``` $\\leq \\alpha$. Consequently, we reject/fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is sufficient/insufficient evidence to suggest a significant difference in the average height of the sample compared to the population mean.
