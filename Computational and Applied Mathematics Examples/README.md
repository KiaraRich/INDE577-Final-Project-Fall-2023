# Introduction to my Computational and Applied Mathematics Examples Folder

![image](CompMath.jpg)

Greetings! I am currently enrolled in the esteemed Computational and Applied Mathematics master's program at Rice University, where I have been immersing myself in the intricate world of mathematical theories and their practical applications. As a testament to my academic journey, this folder serves as a curated showcase highlighting my ability to seamlessly integrate the concepts acquired throughout the program into tangible examples encountered in my core courses.

Within the confines of this digital folder, you will find a collection of meticulously crafted projects. While a folder on this specific topic is not mandated as part of the final project for this course, I believe it provides a valuable snapshot of my academic growth and showcases the versatility of the skills I have acquired in INDE 577. I wanted to translate some techniques I learned in INDE 577 to my Computational Mathematics core courses. That is the point of this folder. Consider it some bonus work!

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey through Computational and Applied Mathematics. May this portfolio serve as a testament to the symbiotic relationship between theory and application, a principle I hold dear in my pursuit of excellence in this dynamic field.
