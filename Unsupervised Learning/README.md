# Introduction to my Unsupervised Learning Folder

Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning where the algorithm is tasked with finding patterns and relationships in a dataset without explicit guidance from labeled outcomes. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, unsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data, making it particularly useful for uncovering hidden structures and intrinsic patterns within the information. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are two primary types of unsupervised learning techniques. In clustering, the algorithm groups similar data points together, revealing natural divisions in the data. Common clustering algorithms in Python include K-means and hierarchical clustering. Dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, aims to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining its essential characteristics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction in Python. Unsupervised learning is crucial in various applications, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. Python's scikit-learn library provides a comprehensive set of tools for implementing unsupervised learning algorithms, enabling data scientists and analysts to explore and extract valuable insights from unstructured or unlabeled data efficiently.

This folder houses two Unsupervised Learning techniques I've aquired throughout this course. Fell free to browse around!
